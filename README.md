FCFS:

Process Order: P1 -> P2 -> P3 -> P4

Average Waiting Time: 31.25

Average Turnaround Time: 57.5

SJF: Process Order: P1 -> P4 -> P2 -> P3

Average Waiting Time: 23.75

Average Turnaround Time: 50.0

Priority Scheduling:

Process Order: P1 -> P2 -> P4 -> P3

Average Waiting Time: 25.0

Average Turnaround Time: 51.25

In this specific scenario, where the goal is to minimize waiting and turnaround times, SJF appears to be the most efficient and fair scheduling algorithm. It reduces both waiting

and turnaround times by selecting the shortest jobs first. Priority Scheduling also performs well in terms of fairness and efficiency but doesn't outperform SJF in this case.

Efficiency:

SJF provides the most efficient scheduling in terms of both average waiting time and average turnaround time. It minimizes the waiting and turnaround times by selecting the 

shortest job first, resulting in the shortest overall completion time.

Priority Scheduling also performs quite well in terms of efficiency, as it prioritizes tasks based on urgency. While it's not as efficient as SJF in this specific case, it strikes

a balance between urgency and job length.

Fairness:

FCFS is not very fair because it doesn't consider job length or urgency. Longer jobs can cause significant delays for shorter ones.

SJF provides fairness in the sense that shorter jobs are prioritized, which can benefit tasks with shorter execution times. However, it may not consider urgency or priority, which

could be important in other scenarios.

Priority Scheduling is fair in terms of urgency, as it prioritizes tasks based on their urgency levels. However, it may not necessarily minimize job length or waiting times.
